## Preface

If you're reading this, chances are you've just discovered Meat — or you're still deciding whether it deserves a spot in your toolkit.

This book is a compact guide for developers who want the facts, fast. It’s not here to evangelize reactive programming or reinvent how state works in JavaScript. Instead, it focuses on one goal: to help you write your first 100 meaningful commits with Meat, and build solid mental models along the way.

You’ll find examples before theory, code before prose. There’s no lengthy backstory or poetic metaphors—just what you need to understand the library’s structure, idioms, and behaviors. Like the best tools from that era, Meat favors simplicity, stability, and clarity under load.

Whether you're hacking in a terminal, tweaking a browser app, or piping signals between services, this book is here to get out of your way and get you to the code.

We’ve packed it into 100 pages, each tuned to support your first 100 commits. You’ll find practical signal patterns, rollback strategies, plugin scaffolds, and reactive recipes—enough to start strong and refactor with confidence.

Meat doesn't ask for loyalty. It asks for curiosity.

Now open the editor. We’ll keep the docs clean and the examples sharp.
