## Commitment: Read This First

This section lives before the introduction, before anything else.  

**Why? Because it’s too useful not to read first.**  

_100% Real No Fake: Like a README.md in a repo you cloned at 2 a.m., only better._  

Before you start flipping pages or inspecting signals, take a moment here.  

This matrix was built so you don’t waste time guessing what page solves your actual problem.

We called it “Commitment” because this book isn’t just a reference—it’s a developer promise. Every commit range below represents a phase you’ll hit as you build with MEAT: from signal basics to DEFCON-grade failsafes.

### Commits 0–10: Signal Fundamentals  
#### Pages 22–26  
Understand the signal engine: how state flows, reacts, and rolls through your app.
- Core API: `get`, `set`, `subscribe`, `watch`, `once`, `merge()`  
- DOM binding, listener teardown  
#### Look Forward to:  
- Pages **66–69** → Advanced signal chaining & visibility sentinels  
- Page **73** → Snapshot isolation: read-only state derived from those same get/set flows  
- Page **97** → Meat Signal Cheatsheet: summary of signal methods and teardown ops  
- Page **98** → Signal Patterns: real-world analogies of reactive behavior

### Commits 10–30: Composition & Injection  
#### Pages 30–56  
Extend MEAT using plugins, diagnostics, and reactive extensions.
- Plugin injection, mutation counter, logger  
- Persist state, style UI with signal data  
- Input reset + mirror binding  
#### Look Back to:  
- Pages **22–26** → You’re building on top of the signal engine  
#### Look Forward to:  
- Pages **62–69** → Scoped plugin composition + lifecycle  
- Page **70** → Circuit breaker logic mirrors your logger-style pattern  
- Page **97** → Meat Signal Cheatsheet: plugin and injection references at a glance  
- Page **98** → Signal Patterns: intuitive mapping of plugin strategies

### Commits 30–60: Sync & Reactive Flows  
#### Pages 57–65  
Scale your app’s state across tabs, storage, and remote systems.
- Form autosave + offline backoff  
- BroadcastChannel and signal syncing  
- Devtools overlay + component loader  
#### Look Back to:  
- Pages **30–40** → Local input sync sets the foundation for remote federation  
#### Look Forward to:  
- Pages **71–73** → WebSocket safety flows echo your tab-to-tab sync logic  
- Page **75** → Plugin cleanup strategies mirror teardown in dynamic loaders  
- Page **98** → Signal Patterns: mutation & sync metaphors for scale

### Commits 60–90: Advanced Signal Patterns  
#### Pages 66–69  
Complex signal orchestration for serious builders.
- Scoped plugin injection, visibility sentinel  
- Graph watchers, signal pagination  
- Timeboxed revert flows  
#### Look Back to:  
- Pages **22–26** → Signal methods used recursively in watchers  
- Page **54** → Listener teardown pattern resurfaces with advanced guards  
#### Look Forward to:  
- Pages **72–73** → GDPR scrub + safety flows are plugin-driven variants of scoped injection  
- Page **98** → Signal Patterns: decision-based abstractions for advanced flows

### Commits 90–100: DEFCON 1 Safety Flows  
#### Pages 70–73  
For mission-critical logic, fail-safe reactivity, and release polish.
- Atomic rollback, GDPR scrub, WebSocket failsafe  
- Quiz logic, commit index, final polish  
#### Look Back to:  
- Page **53** → Your rollback strategy builds on `meat.safe()`  
- Pages **55–56** → State serialization underpins snapshot recovery  
- Pages **60–65** → Broadcast & sync flows directly inform WebSocket logic
